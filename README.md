# Chess
Chess in C++ and SDL.

Requires linking SDL2 and SDL2_ttf libraries. If you want to modify this code,make sure to link those libraries to your visual studio solution.

If you just want to see it in action, Download the ```/Release``` folder with all the dll files in it and run chess.exe.

Thank you :smiley:
